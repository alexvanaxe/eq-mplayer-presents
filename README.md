#eq-mplayer-presents

A script to change the equializer settings on mplayer. It is really useful when using the player from the command line.

It is a simple Script, I usualy create an alias in the linux machine like: 

'''
    alias setmplayereq='path/to/script'
'''

Then I run the command and change my settings.
